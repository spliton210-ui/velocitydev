## Selection Criteria (Critical)

### ✅ You'll Consider Equity Partnerships When:

**The Founder:**
- Has domain expertise in the industry
- Demonstrates strong work ethic and commitment
- Has complementary skills (sales, marketing, industry connections)
- Is full-time or going full-time on this
- Has skin in the game (their own time/money invested)
- Communicates clearly and professionally

**The Idea:**
- Solves a real problem (not just "cool idea")
- Has validation (customers expressing interest, letters of intent, waitlist)
- Clear path to revenue (not "we'll figure that out later")
- Reasonable scope for AI-accelerated development
- You understand the market enough to evaluate it
- Not in an industry you're uncomfortable with

**The Business Model:**
- SaaS with recurring revenue potential
- B2B with clear customer acquisition path
- Marketplace with network effects
- Platform with scale potential
- NOT: Low-margin, highly competitive commodity plays

**The Deal:**
- Equity stake is meaningful (10%+ for MVP, 15%+ for full build)
- Clear vesting terms (protects both parties)
- Clean cap table (not 12 advisors with 2% each)
- Founder owns majority (you're partner, not co-founder)
- Exit potential realistic (M&A or growth to profitability)

### ❌ You'll Pass When:

- "Just an idea" with no validation
- Founder won't go full-time
- Unclear business model
- Overly complex technical requirements
- Regulated industries (healthcare, finance) without proper expertise
- Founder wants you to do sales/marketing too
- "We just need a developer" attitude (not valuing what you bring)
- Cap table is a mess
- Founder has done this 5 times before (serial idea person)
- Your equity would be <10% for significant work

---

## Positioning & Marketing

### Track 1 Messaging (Fee-for-Service)
**"Fast, Affordable Software Development for Established Businesses"**

Where: Website, LinkedIn (primary), direct outreach to SMBs

### Track 2 Messaging (Equity Partnerships)
**"Your Technical Co-Founder Alternative: CTO-Level Expertise + Lightning-Fast Development"**

Where: Startup communities, founder groups, Y Combinator/Indie Hackers forums

---

## Separate Brand Presence for Equity Track

### Recommended: Sub-Domain from Day One
- **velocitydev.ai** → Fee-for-service (established businesses)
- **ventures.velocitydev.ai** → Equity partnerships (startups)

**Why this is the better approach:**
✅ Clear brand separation from launch
✅ Different positioning without confusion
✅ Professional "ventures" terminology (industry standard)
✅ Easy to manage (same Cloudflare account)
✅ Can have different design/messaging
✅ Easier to track analytics separately
✅ Builds "VelocityDev Ventures" as distinct offering

**Technical Setup:**
- Create subdomain in Cloudflare (takes 2 minutes)
- Deploy ventures site to ventures.velocitydev.ai
- Set up ventures@velocitydev.ai email
- Cross-link between sites where appropriate

---

**The Solution:**
Your technical co-founder alternative:

5. Let's build

**Application Button:**

## LinkedIn Content Strategy - Track 2

### Additional Content Themes

**Post Type 1: "The Technical Co-Founder Myth"**
Breaking down why finding technical co-founders is so hard and why equity partnerships with experienced developers make sense.

**Post Type 2: "Startup Stories"**
When you start doing equity deals, share anonymized stories:
- "How we validated an idea in 3 weeks for $1,500"
- "From concept to paying customers in 8 weeks"
- Builds proof for this model

**Post Type 3: "What I Look For"**
Transparent posts about your selection criteria. Attracts right founders, filters out wrong ones.

**Post Type 4: "Founder Red Flags"**
Things that make you pass on equity deals. Positions you as selective and experienced.

## Financial Modeling

### Fee-for-Service (Track 1)
**Annual Goal (Year 1):**
- 6 projects @ average $10K = $60K
- Your effective hourly rate: ~$150-200/hour
- Predictable, immediate income
- Lower risk

### Equity Partnerships (Track 2)
**Annual Goal (Year 1):**
- 3-4 equity deals
- Reduced cash: $2,500 average × 4 = $10K
- Equity: 15-20% in 4 companies

**Outcomes Scenario (5 years):**
- 2 fail completely (50%) = $0
- 1 stays small (25%) = $0
- 1 exits or reaches profitability (25%) = potential $50K-500K+

**The Math:**
Even if only 1 in 4 succeeds modestly, potential upside >> the cash discount you gave.

### Hybrid Strategy (Recommended)
- **Track 1**: 60% of time (reliable income)
- **Track 2**: 40% of time (upside potential)
- Diversified risk
- Multiple revenue streams
- Build portfolio of equity stakes

---

## Risk Mitigation

### For You:
1. **Minimum cash threshold** ($1K+ even for equity deals)
2. **Vesting schedules** (equity vests over time)
3. **Clear scope limits** (no scope creep on equity deals)
4. **Selection criteria** (be picky, most will fail anyway)
5. **Legal protection** (simple equity agreements, reviewed by lawyer once)
6. **Time caps** (max 12 weeks per equity project)

### For Founders:
1. **Vesting both ways** (you don't just disappear after build)
2. **Clear deliverables** (what they're getting defined upfront)
3. **Support period** (you're there post-launch)
4. **Technical advisory** (ongoing strategic guidance)
5. **Fair equity** (not taking advantage)

---

## Legal Essentials

### You Need:
1. **Simple Equity Agreement Template** (get lawyer to draft once, ~$1K-2K)
2. **Service Agreement** (what you're building)
3. **IP Assignment** (you retain some rights to code patterns, they get exclusive use)
4. **Vesting Schedule Terms** (protect both parties)

### Key Terms to Include:
- Equity percentage
- Vesting schedule (12-24 months typical)
- Role definition (advisor, not employee)
- Time commitment (X hours per month post-launch)
- Exit provisions (what happens if acquired)
- IP ownership (they own the specific product, you keep general code patterns)

**Investment:** $1,500-3,000 for lawyer to create templates you reuse

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Deal Breakers:
🚩 "I'll give you 5% equity" (for 12 weeks of work? Pass.)
🚩 "We don't need revenue, we'll raise $5M" (overconfident, no business model)
🚩 "The app is really simple, should only take 2 weeks" (unrealistic expectations)
🚩 "Can you also handle marketing/sales?" (wants you to do everything)
🚩 "I've started 10 companies" (serial idea person, never finishes)
🚩 "I'm keeping 90%, you get 10%" (not valuing technical contribution)
🚩 Founder is doing this part-time (not serious)
🚩 Idea requires hardware/biotech/regulatory approvals (too complex)
🚩 "We'll pivot once we see what works" (no validation)
🚩 Cap table has 8 advisors at 2% each (red flag on cap management)

## The Pitch (For Founders)

### Track 2 Positioning Statement:

**"Finding a technical co-founder is nearly impossible. And most can't bring what I bring:**

**25 years of technology leadership. 12 years as CTO. Director of Infrastructure for a global organization.**

**I don't just code—I architect systems that scale, make strategic technical decisions, and think like an executive.**

**Plus AI-accelerated development means your MVP is ready in 6-8 weeks, not 6-8 months.**

**I'm selective. I only work with 3-4 startups per year on equity partnerships. But for the right founder with the right idea, I bring CTO-level expertise at a fraction of the cost—aligned with your success through equity.**

**Not looking for a job. Not looking to be your employee. Looking for founders who need strategic technical leadership to turn validated ideas into revenue-generating products.**

**If that's you, let's talk."**

## My Recommendation

**Year 1 Mix:**
- **70% Track 1** (fee-for-service) → Reliable income, lower risk
- **30% Track 2** (equity partnerships) → Upside potential, 2-3 deals max

**Why:**
- You need income now (Track 1)
- You want upside later (Track 2)
- Diversified risk
- Test equity model without betting everything on it
- Build portfolio of potential winners

**Year 2+ Adjust Based on Results:**
- If equity deals are working → increase to 50/50
- If not getting traction → stay 80/20 or drop equity track
- Let the market tell you what works

---

**The bottom line:** Your background (CTO, Infrastructure Director, 25 years) is PERFECT for equity partnerships with startups. You're not just a developer—you're strategic technical leadership. That's worth equity.

But start cautiously, be selective, and keep fee-for-service as your foundation.
